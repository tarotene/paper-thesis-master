I would like to thank Prof.~Hatano for useful discussions. I am grateful to Dr.~Hinokihara in the Miyashita group, Department of Physics, the University of Tokyo, for sharing his expertise on the parallel computing techniques. I also thank Dr.~Tamura, National Institute for Material Science, for useful comments on precursors of critical phenomena in finite-size systems. I would also like to express my gratitude to the members of the Hatano group and my family for their moral support and warm encouragements.
