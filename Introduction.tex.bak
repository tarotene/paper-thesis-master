\chapter{Introduction}
%The system is one of the simplest model of two-dimensional magnetic friction. Its spatial and spin dimensionality are far from realistic materials around us. However, we can use several facts from the exact solution for the two-dimensional Ising model, which makes the analysis easier than higher-dimensional cases.
In this chapter we introduce two of the most famous problems in analyzing the frictional force as the problem of statistical mechanics. We give recent developments for solving these problems. We then pose another problem regarding \textit{manipulation} of the sliding friction which occurs in highly lubricated solids. To this end we simplify our problem into a dimensional crossover in lattice systems.

The sliding friction in solids is a very complicated problem to analyze, despite the fact that our daily lives are linked with it in various forms. One reason of the difficulty is that there is no general theory which determines the most important microscopic degree of freedom for the sliding friction as a macroscopic phenomenon.

One may think that with the skill of statistical mechanics we can deal with the problem in a systematic manner. However, there are several essential problems including the following: (1). The sliding friction is essentially non-equilibrium phenomenon (see Section\ref{sec:NESliding}). (2). We cannot directly observe the sliding surface (see Section\ref{sec:IMPObsSlSf}).

\section{Sliding Frictions as Non-Equilibrium Problems}\label{sec:NESliding}
We can regard the sliding friction the following elementary problem. We consider an object $O$ and a substrate $S$, and let $S$ slide against $O$ by adding an external force. When $O$ and $S$ interact with each other, the kinetic energy of $O$ given by the external force is expected to be lost through the interaction, and then the entire system $O+S$ heats up (if the system is closed) or the energy dissipates from the system to an external environment (if the system is open). In the latter case, under the assumption that the dissipation process is stationary, the frictional force takes a constant value balancing with the external force. This setup is realized when we control the external force $f_{\rm ext}$ so that the sliding velocity $v$ may be constant. Then the frictional force $f_{\rm fric}$ can be considered as a function of the sliding velocity.

The traditional way of the statistical mechanics called the linear response theory appears to solve the problem if the velocity is much smaller than the rate $\xi/\tau$, where $\xi$ and $\tau$ are the characteristic length and time of the system, respectively. However, we already know well that the static frictional force is non-zero for several systems, for which the frictional force has a non-linear velocity dependence. This shows us the complexity of the problem which cannot be captured by applying the traditional way.


Several model calculations and experiments have solved these problems, directly or indirectly. Phononic contributions to sliding frictions were analyzed by the Frenkel-Kontorova model, whereas eletronic contributions were discovered and explained within an image potential theory. Furthermore as additional phenomena, sliding frictions between adsorbed Helium atoms and its substrates are recently getting attention, but their theoretical description is still not satisfactory and remains to an open problem.

\section{Impossibility of the Observation of the Sliding Surface}\label{sec:IMPObsSlSf}
The dimensionality of the sliding surface is up to two, if that of the whole system is three. Sliding surfaces are different in many ways from the standard two-dimensional surfaces on three-dimensional solids which have been investigated for many years, so that we cannot perform a direct observation of the sliding surface by apparatuses such as microscopes. The difficulty prevents us from clarifying non-equilibrium properties of the sliding friction.

There is a way to observe the sliding surface with the microscope and optically transparent matters, but most researches avoid a direct observations by measuring other observables to observe the sliding surface indirectly.

\section{Manipulating the Friction}

Recent researches well revealed the nature of sliding frictions. This gave rise to new problems about the friction in atomically microscopic systems.

Ordinary frictions in solids are mostly governed by excitations of phonon degrees of freedom, because the sliding surface is almost always rougher than the scale of the atom. Once we lubricate the sliding surface highly, other degrees of freedom such as the orbital and the spin angular momenta of electrons emerge as additional contributions to the friction.

We are already familiar with the most remarkable example of such a system in our daily lives, namely \textit{micro electric mechanical systems} (\textbf{MEMS}). MEMS plays important roles in the printing head of inkjet printers, the accelerometer in smartphones and so on. MEMS has clean planes sliding with an accuracy of a micrometer or a nanometer, because of which they experience a new type of the friction that \textcolor{red}{<explanation>}. The small size of these systems makes \textcolor{red}{the problem} more serious, because the ratio of the surface area over the volume of the system become larger with the smaller size and a fixed geometry.

We have to tackle with the issue of manipulation the friction in such small systems by getting more fundamental knowledges of the friction.

\section{Magnetic Friction}
In this work we consider two strips of the quasi-one-dimensional Ising model sliding against each other with a fixed velocity. We discuss the difference of the frictional forces for the two boundary conditions, the anti-parallel and the parallel, and its dependence on the distance from one boundary to the other.

Based on the results in Ref.\cite{Hucht2009b}, we consider a dimensional crossover from one dimension to two in Ising models with two fixed boundary conditions. In the one-dimensional limit the boundary conditions seem to have the maximum effect on the friction, whereas in the two-dimensional limit there seems to be no effects. Behaviors in the both limits for the free boundary conditions correspond to the results in Ref.\cite{Hucht2009b}. We find a method of manipulating the friction using different boundary conditions. These boundary conditions can be realized in experiments  by aligning the boundary spins of sliding magnets.

The way to manipulate the friction in such small systems is less understood than its nature. We here consider manipulation of magnetic materials numerically simulating lattice models and their numerical simulations. 

Frictions in such models were considered first in a numerical study by Kadau \textit{et al.}\cite{Kadau2008}. They revealed by Monte Carlo simulations that two square lattices of the Ising model which slide against each other experience the friction, depending on the temperature and the sliding velocity. Immediately after the research, it was revealed\cite{Hucht2009b} that the Ising model goes under a non-trivial non-equilibrium phase transition (\textbf{NEPT}) in the high-velocity limit, where the two square lattices are decoupled in terms of the correlation between the two lattices and feel an effective mean field depending on the magnetization of each other\cite{Hucht2009b}. This analysis showed that a novel critical point which is located at a generally higher temperature than the ordinal critical point for models in arbitrary dimensions and geometries (see Chapter \ref{ch:review}). They also developed a new dynamics\cite{Hucht2009b} which enables an analytical treatment for finite sliding velocities, obtaining the non-equilibrium critical line.
