\chapter{Velocity-driven Non-equilibrium Phase Transition in Ising Models}\label{ch:review}

To discuss the non-equilibrium crossover between two different dimensions, we have to make a brief review of the exact results\cite{Hucht2009b} by Hucht. His analysis is based on the fact that two Ising cylinders with relative motion make a novel mean field and they lead the system to a non-trivial phase transition.

We now consider two equivalent square lattices of Ising model each of which contacts with the other by one of its one-dimensional boundary. If we leave two models alone, we can regard the models as an Ising model with a twice the size. With the coupling to the heat bath, we expect the model thermalize. But one of the couple are moving along the contact plane with a constant velocity $v$, the entire model goes into a non-equilibrium stationary state, instead of thermalization. The non-equilibrium stationary state well describes the behavior of two magnetic materials with a friction. This setup are explained in detail in Chapter \ref{chap:NumSim}.

As a well known fact, the ordinary two dimensional Ising model has the phase transition at the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}=2/(\log\left[1+\sqrt{2}\right])$ in the thermodynamical limit $N/V\to\infty$, $N/V=\text{const.}$, where $N$ is the number of spins and $V$ is the volume of the system as a well known fact. The model with the friction becomes equivalent to the equilibrium case for the limit of $v\to 0$. The result\cite{Hucht2009b} claims that the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ \textit{branches} at the point $v=0$ towards the limit $v=\infty$. Now we denote the velocity dependent non-equilibrium critical point by $T_{\rm c}(v)$ apart from the equilibrium critical point $T_{\rm eq, c}$. The system exhibits the ordinary phase transition and a novel phase transition where the magnetization grows up near the inner boundary rather than the rest (See Figure \ref{fig:NEPTinIsing}).

These phenomena were first reported in the numerical results\cite{Kadau2008} by Kadau et al. using Monte Carlo simulations both on the Metropolis rate and on the Glauber rate in a two-dimensional model, and then investigated in more analytic manner\cite{Hucht2009b} by Hucht for several dimensions and model geometries. One of the important point in the latter result is that for the limit of $v\to 0$ we can write the closed exact equation for the \textit{second} critical temperature $T_{\rm c}(\infty)$. In addition it is also important that a novel algorithm, called \textit{multipricative rate}, enabled us to give the equation of $T_{\rm c}(v)$ which fully depends on the flip rate and the sliding velocity $v>0$.

If the velocity $v$ is much less than the rate $\xi^{(\rm eq)}_{x}(\beta)/\tau^{(\rm eq)}_{x}(\beta)$, we can expect the system to behave well similarly to its equilibrium state, where $\xi^{(\rm eq)}_{x}(\beta)$ and $\tau^{(\rm eq)}_{x}(\beta)$ are the correlation length along the direction parallel to the sliding surface and the correlation time respectively for the equilibrium state of an inverse temperature $\beta:=(k_{\rm B}T)^{-1}$. This corresponds to the case that the pumped energy by the constant sliding is most quickly relaxed towards the heat bath and the structure of domain walls near the inner boundary is well sustained. On the other hand, the velocity $v$ much greater than the rate $\xi^{(\rm eq)}_{x}(\beta)/\tau^{(\rm eq)}_{x}(\beta)$ will lead the system to a stationary state much far from equilibrium so that the structure near the inner boundary will be destroyed. 

In the latter case a mean field picture well describes the behavior of the system, where two sets of the moving spins along the contact plane act on the other \textit{relatively} moving spins as the spatially-averaged effective field. In other words, the magnetization of one half of the system corresponds the effective field of the other, and vice versa. This enables us to write a self-consistent equation for the temperature $T_{\rm c}(\infty)$.

We summarize the result for one-dimensional chains and that of two-dimensional planes, in order to discuss the crossover from one-dimension to two-dimension in our models in Chapter \ref{chap:Summary}.

We first give a general Hamiltonian of the Ising model as follows.
\begin{align}
\beta \mathcal{H}_{\mu}:=-\sum_{i<j}K_{ij}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}-\sum_{i}(h^{\rm ext}_{i}+k_{i}\mu_{i})\sigma_{i},
\end{align}
where $K_{ij}$, $h^{\rm ext}_{i}$ and $k_{i}\mu_{i}$ denotes the interaction between the $i$-th spin and the $j$-th one, the static field on the $i$-th spin and the stochastic field on the $i$-th spin ($\mu_{i}=\pm 1$) respectively. Now we assume that $\mu_{i}$ obeys the probability distribution $p_{i}(\mu_{i})$ such that $\langle\mu_{i}\rangle:=\sum_{\mu_{i}=\pm 1}p_{i}(\mu_{i})\mu_{i}=m_{i}$ for a given $m_{i}$. The form $p_{i}(\mu_{i}):=(1+\mu_{i}m_{i})/2$ actually satisfies the condition. 

If we decompose the Hamiltonian into the contribution of the stochastic field and the rest one ($\beta \mathcal{H}_{0}:=-\sum_{i<j}K_{ij}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}-\sum_{i}h^{\rm ext}_{i}\sigma_{i}$) as
\begin{align}
\beta \mathcal{H}_{\mu} = \beta \mathcal{H}_{0} - \sum_{i}k_{i}\mu_{i}\sigma_{i},
\end{align}
the partition function of the system is written as
\begin{align}
\mathcal{Z} = \mathrm{Tr}_{\sigma \mu}\left[\mathrm{e}^{-\beta \mathcal{H}_{\mu}}\right] = \mathrm{Tr}_{\sigma}\left[\mathrm{e}^{-\beta \mathcal{H}_{0}}\mathrm{Tr}_{\mu}\left[\prod_{i}\mathrm{e}^{k_{i}\mu_{i}\sigma_{i}}\right]\right] = \prod_{i}\cosh k_{i}\mathrm{Tr}_{\sigma}\left[\mathrm{e}^{-\beta \mathcal{H}_{0}}\prod_{i}(1+\sigma_{i}m_{i}\tanh k_{i})\right].\label{eq:Z}
\end{align}

On the other hand, if we give again a model with $k_{i}=0$ as
\begin{align}
\beta\mathcal{H}_{\rm eq}:=-\sum_{i<j}K_{ij}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}-\sum_{i}h_{i}\sigma_{i}
\end{align}
which relaxes toward the well known equilibrium state, it holds that $\beta\mathcal{H}_{\rm eq}=\beta\mathcal{H}_{0} - \sum_{i}b_{i}\sigma_{i}$ ($b_{i}:=h_{i}-h^{\rm ext}_{i}$) and its partition function are written as
\begin{align}
\mathcal{Z}_{\rm eq}=\mathrm{Tr}_{\sigma}\left[\mathrm{e}^{-\beta\mathcal{H}_{\rm eq}}\right]=&\mathrm{Tr}_{\sigma}\left[\mathrm{e}^{\beta \mathcal{H}_{0}}\sum_{i}\mathrm{e}^{b_{i}\sigma_{i}}\right]\\
=&\prod_{i}\cosh b_{i}\mathrm{Tr}_{\sigma}\left[\mathrm{e}^{-\beta\mathcal{H}_{0}}\prod_{i}(1+\sigma_{i}\tanh b_{i})\right].\label{eq:Zeq}
\end{align}

Comparing right hand sides of \eqref{eq:Zeq} and \eqref{eq:Z}, we have
\begin{align}
\mathcal{Z} = \prod_{i}\frac{\cosh k_{i}}{\cosh b_{i}}\mathcal{Z}_{\rm eq}
\end{align}
under the condition $\tanh b_{i}=m_{i}\tanh k_{i}$.

We consider the model with the condition $h^{\rm ext}_{i}=0$. Due to the translation invariance along the sliding direction, we have the homogeneous boundary magnetization $m_{i}=m_{\rm b}$ for all sites $\{i\}$. It results in the self-consistency that each boundary magnetization on the two internal-boundary lines act on each other as an effective field, and it holds that $h_{i}=h_{\rm b}$ for an existing $h_{\rm b}$ and all $i$. Substituting them into the condition $\tanh b_{i}=m_{i}\tanh k_{i}$, we have
\begin{align}
h_{\rm b}=\tanh^{-1}[m_{\rm b}\tanh K_{\rm b}].
\end{align}

The boundary magnetization under a static field $h_{\rm b}$, in general, have a form of
\begin{align}
m_{\rm b, eq}[K,h_{\rm b}]:=\frac{\partial}{\partial h_{\rm eq}}\log\left[\mathcal{Z}_{\rm eq}\right],
\end{align}
and thus we have
\begin{align}
m_{\rm b, eq}[K,\tanh^{-1}\left[m_{b}\tanh K_{b}\right]]=m_{b}\label{cond:critcond1}
\end{align}
as a self-consistent relation for $m_{b}$.

As the well known relation, it holds that for the critical point
\begin{align}
1=\left.\frac{\partial m_{\rm b,eq}}{\partial m_{\rm b}}\right|_{m_{\rm b}=0}.\label{rel:CritTilt}
\end{align}
Expanding the left hand side of \eqref{rel:CritTilt} to the first order of $m_{\rm b}$ around the $m_{\rm b} = 0$, we have
\begin{align}
m_{\rm b,eq}[K,\tanh^{-1}\left[0\right] + m_{b}\tanh\left[K_{\rm b}\right]\left.\frac{\partial m_{\rm b,eq}}{\partial h_{\rm b}}\right|_{h_{\rm b}=0} = m_{b}
\end{align}
and thus with the definition of the susceptibility at an equilibrium $\chi^{(0)}_{\rm b, eq}(K):=\left.\partial m_{\rm b,eq}/\partial h_{\rm b}\right|_{h_{\rm b}=0}$ and the fact $m_{\rm b,eq}\left[K,\tanh^{-1}\left[0\right]\right]=0$, we finally have
\begin{align}
\tanh\left[K_{\rm b}\right]\chi^{(0)}_{\rm b, eq}(K) = 1\label{cond:critcond2}
\end{align}
for the critical condition. The condition \eqref{cond:critcond1} or \eqref{cond:critcond2} determines the non-equilibrium critical temperature for the limit $v\to\infty$. Using the expression of the magnetization for one-dimensional model and the boudnary magnetization for two-dimensional model, we have the numerical solution of the condition
\begin{align}
T_{\mathrm{c},d=2} = 2.2691853\dots\\
T_{\mathrm{c},d=3} = 2.6614725\dots
\end{align}
respectively for the isotropic case $K=K_{\rm b}$.
