\chapter{Summary and Discussion}\label{chap:Summary}

In this paper, we considered fixing the boundary condition on the two boundary planes parallel to the slip plane as manipulating the magnetic friction in two-dimensional systems and investigated the effects of fixing variations on the magnetic friction by changing the distance $L_{z}$ between the two boundary planes. As the result, we discovered that two scales of length, the distance $L_{z}$ and the correlation length $\xi_{z}$, makes a dimensional crossover from one-dimension to two-dimension. We also saw that peaks of the derivatives, $\partial f(L_{z},T)/\partial T$ and $\partial \epsilon_{\rm b}/\partial T$, for  cases of size $L_{z}=4$ and $L_{z}=64$, and both of them imply the non-equilibrium phase transition reported by Hucht\cite{Hucht2009b} and the locations of peaks are consistent to their results for the case $v=10$.

For future works, we are going to investigate
\begin{itemize}
\item Consistency between the case of free boundary condition to the results by Hucht\cite{Hucht2009b}
\item Divergence of derivatives of the \textit{boundary} energy (or boundary capacity) for the limit of two-dimension
\item Behavior of the correlation length itself
\item Dimensional crossover of the critical exponents of $\partial f(L_{z},T)/\partial T$ and $\partial \epsilon_{\rm b}/\partial T$
\end{itemize}
to analyze the phenomena in more detail. We intend to see whether dimensional crossovers in models with other spatial dimensions or continuous symmetries.
