\chapter{Introduction}

The system is one of the simplest model of two-dimensional magnetic friction. Its spatial and spin dimensionality are far from realistic materials around us. However, we can use several facts from the exact solution for the two-dimensional Ising model, which makes the analysis easier than higher-dimensional cases.
